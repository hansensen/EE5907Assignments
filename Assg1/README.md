# Q1. Beta-binomial Naïve Bayes

## Question Interpretation:
This question asks to use generative module, naïve bayes classifier. The equation is:

![p(\tilde{y} = c | \tilde{x}, D) \propto  log p(\tilde{y} = c | \lambda ^{ML}) + \sum_{j=1}^{D}log p(\tilde{x}_{j} |x_{i\in cj}, \lambda ^{ML})](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(\tilde{y}%20=%20c%20|%20\tilde{x},%20D)%20\propto%20%20log%20p(\tilde{y}%20=%20c%20|%20\lambda%20^{ML})%20+%20\sum_{j=1}^{D}log%20p(\tilde{x}_{j}%20|x_{i\in%20cj},%20\lambda%20^{ML}))

## Approach:

Since the email can only be classified as spam or non-spam, y can only be 0 or 1. In order to get ![p(\tilde{y} = 0 | \tilde{x}, D)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(\tilde{y}%20=%200%20|%20\tilde{x},%20D)) and ![p(\tilde{y} = 1 | \tilde{x}, D)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(\tilde{y}%20=%201%20|%20\tilde{x},%20D)), calculate first term and the sum of the following terms respectively.
